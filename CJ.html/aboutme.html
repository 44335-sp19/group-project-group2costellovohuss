                <h1>Experience:</h1>
                <p class="experience">Knacktive:</p>
                <p>I was an Art Director for the Spring 2019 Knacktive class.  In this position I was in charge of the artistic direction of projects, as well as developing brand identity and other creative elements.  This experience helped me gain insight into what life is like, working for an advertising or marketing agency.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="experience">Photography:</p>
                <p>Over the past five years I have been able to build an extensive photography portfolio.  I have done multiple shoots for senior pictures, a wedding, and anything else I thought would be fun to photograph.  Someday I would like to start my own part-time photography business.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="experience">Ted's Covers and Tarps:</p>
                <p>During the Summer months and other breaks from school, I go home to work for Ted's Covers and Tarps.  I am currently the Assistant Manager of Operations there.  At Ted's I have a lot of different responsibilities and tasks, I do anything from sewing boat covers, to woodworking for upholstery projects, and even working with customers.</p>
