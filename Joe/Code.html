  <h3>Class Work of code</h3>
  <p>The first example of my work is this website. This was a group project in my Script Programming class. While it was a group project, all of my pages were made by me personal.</p>
    <p>The program who I would like to show is a bit to large to include on this page, so I am going to describe what it was. It is was a large Java project for my Computer Programming II class in college. We were tasked to make a simple RPG game called Javaquest. I will post a sample of what I worked on below.</p>
